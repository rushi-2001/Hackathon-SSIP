# Hackathon-SSIP
## Our Team of 6 Students participated in SSIP Hackathon organised by Gujarat Government.
## Our topic was : Cleanliness Automation using Deep Learning.
### Under that idea, we prepared two mobile Apps as a product namely 1)Swatchta Soldier and 1)Clean India
### Swatchta Soldier App is for government Authorities 
### Clean India App is for citizens

#### The main issue was, govt. garbage vehicles collect garbage from their pre-specified placces, but some places which have garbage which is observed by citizens everyday but cannot inform govt. about this.
#### So we made these two app to solve this biggest issue and connect citizens and govt. authorities through APPs.
#### In this we citizen can upload images where they find garbage.
#### Using DEEP LEARNING, we identify the category of garbage and also seperate the fake requests.
#### We extract location details from meta data of that image.
#### And then a google map location will be provided to garbage collector (Swatchta Soldier)
#### A proper G-Map path having 15-20 checkpoints of garbage collections will be provided to garbage collector.
#### As soon as their request is completed(garbage is collected) citizens gets notification of it.

### SO , in this way a unique concept and idea of SWATCHTA ABHIYAAN was presented by our Team , and our team is now selected for FINAL ROUND of this Hackathon.
